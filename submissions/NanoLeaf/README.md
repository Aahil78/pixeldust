# **DIY Nanoleaf Project** 
## Overview
This project is a DIY Nanoleaf-style lighting system using WS2812B LEDs, controlled by a Seeeduino XIAO ESP32-C3. The design allows for modular PCB panels, with only one containing the XIAO, while the others have footprints for easy expansion without additional soldering. A frosted acrylic sheet is used as a diffuser for a soft lighting effect.

## Components

## Design
- The project consists of **five** PCBs: one main PCB with the XIAO and four extension PCBs with WS2812B LEDs.
- The PCBs are wired in a way that the XIAO does not need to be soldered onto each extension panel.
- The frosted acrylic sheet serves as a diffuser for a soft glow effect.
- Magnets are used for easy mounting and modular assembly.

## NOTE:
Hey!! I am making 5 nanoleaf(s) one will be the main controle board and other ones will only have 33 neopixels each The total grant becomes = **$46.77** (assuming you provide all the electric components)
