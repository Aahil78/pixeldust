Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?

originally i wanna design like  a 10x10 pixel board so i can display like image,qr,.. on it but i shuddenly have some idea about making  a keypad!
there was not a lot of challenge cuz @tobycm helped me a lot with kicad!(hes the goat 🗣). 

Some images of your design (make sure to include both the PCB and Schematic!):
