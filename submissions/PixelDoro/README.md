A pomodoro clock kind of thing made out of neopixels!
The numbers are represented as colors in the clock.

It also comes with 2 other cool modes, like:

- Random Mode : When enabled, it randomly lights up neopixels with random colors
- RGB Mode: It cycles through all the colors one by one!

## Difficulties

I didn't feel any major difficulty except for the firmware, I was really confused on how to write code for a rotary encoder, or with a push button. After doing some research I found projects which included them and I learned how I could integrate them into my project!
It didn't run in wokwi for a long time without errors, and when it finally did, It felt amazing!
