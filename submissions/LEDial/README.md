I have always been fascinated by thermostats, especially ones by NEST. I was wondering if I could make something similar, but for different information, with larger LEDs instead of a display.


I learned PCB design from hackpad/hackboard. I am super proud of the wiring on the back layer as well as the alignment of the rotary encoder.
