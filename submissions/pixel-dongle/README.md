My submission is a board that uses the ESP32-C3. 
This is for the wifi, so that it can be used on battery as a small temperature/humidity display. 
It has 23 neopixels that wrap around the edge that are for displaying whatever data.
It also has a integrated usb a plug so that it can be directly plugged into a usb port. 
This needs to be connected using a USB C male breakout board wired to the pads by the port.
