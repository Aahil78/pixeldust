Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? Please add a lot of pictures here!!

**Simple NeoMatrix connected to an UltraSonic distance sensor (Provided by me) that shows a circle that grows in proportion to the distance, the closer and object gets to the sensor, the bigger the circle gets and the red-er it gets.**

Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?
The biggest challenge I had to face was learning how to use KiCad, thankfully the slack members helped me a lot, I had to change the design a lot because a slack member would point out an error in my board.


Some images of your design (make sure to include both the PCB and Schematic!):
