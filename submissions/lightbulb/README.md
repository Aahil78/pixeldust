# Lightbulb

Wokwi link: [https://wokwi.com/projects/427793159152694273](https://wokwi.com/projects/427793159152694273)

I made a pcb in the shape of a light bulb to help with finding ideas (like cartoons that a light bulb appears when somebody has an idea). It starts in a "thinking" mode with a spinning blue light. When the button is pressed the pixels start blinking yellow indicating an idea!

Simplified BOM (detailed in file):
| Component | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Capacitor 100uF | 1 |
| Capacitors 4.7nF | 4 |
| WS2812B Neopixels | 14 |
| Push button | 1 |
| XIAO RP2040 | 1 |

The design process was really interesting and I learned how to do complex edge cuts with inkspace. Also, it's the first time I am using neopixels and they seem easy but fun

Some images of the design:
