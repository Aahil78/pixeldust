# Christmas Tree

Wokwi link: [Christmas Tree](https://wokwi.com/projects/427420361279612929)
sometimes the wokwi software lags and glitches. if that happens, then restart the code.


### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? Please add a lot of pictures here!!

My board is a christmas tree. There are three buttons. One button makes a cool rainbow pattern (inspiration from [Mood Matrix](https://wokwi.com/projects/426772422246477825)). Another button flickers 4 different lights over the span of 3 frames. I like to call that theater chase, because it looks like the LEDs are chasing each other. Lastly, there is spiral Wipe, where the leds come in a spiral, and leave in a spiral.

### A simplified BOM table
(i tried to find cheaper neopixels....ðŸ˜­)

ID    |    Cost          |          MFR ref      |            LCSC
1. WS2812B: | $4.05 x 12 = $48.60 |  1655                   |  C2846931 
2. C: | $0.05 x 12 = $0.60        |  WCAP-CSGP-0603         | C30926
3. U2: | $7.49 x 1 = $7.49        |  ESP32S3-DIP            |  N/A
4. C1:	| $0.28 x 1 = $0.28       |  EEE-FC1E101P           |  C336531

## Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?

I started with a paper and made a rough sketch of my design. Then I used my knowelge from the tutorials of kicad and made the board and routed the entire thing, making changes along the way. Some challenges were routing and finding capacitors with specific values. I wish I saw this template before so I could use those capacitors. The tutorials were a great help. 


# Some images of your design (make sure to include both the PCB and Schematic!):
#### IDK why the neopixels, capacitors, and mcu are gone, but its probally nothing.
