# Water Bottle Lamp PCB
This is my submission for Hack Club's Pixeldust YSWS, and it's for a light that goes beneath a water bottle to turn it into a lamp. It was inspired by a life hack I heard of when I was younger and loved watching life hack videos, which instructed the viewer to put their phone's flashlight beneath a bottle to turn it into a lamp. I thought it'd be great to make a PCB version of this (with, inshaAllah/God willing, a 3D printed case + model for this later) since I had the opportunity.
