<!-- Uncomment the line below if you need a soldering iron -->
⚠️ I would like to assemble the other boards other than the one that comes preassembled, so I would be very interested in the hot plate you were talking about.

Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? Please add a lot of pictures here!!

This is a controller that fits to the left side of a 3dconnexion spacemouse, allowing you to have 6 keys and an encoder where you fingers usually rest on the table. This reduces the amount you have to move between the keyboard and spacemouse.

(pls include rough pricing of any extra components you're using)

Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?

Everything was pretty straightforward after hackpad, I just got stuck starting the code as I have been very busy and not had time to get into it.

Some images of your design (make sure to include both the PCB and Schematic!):
