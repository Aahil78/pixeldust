# Raver

Wokwi link: [https://wokwi.com/projects/426625186184011777](https://wokwi.com/projects/426625186184011777)

I made an audio visualizer using JavaScript at [raver.tobycm.dev](https://raver.tobycm.dev), made it into a Chrome extension as well. This will be the sequel to the 2 digital version by having a physical audio visualizer lol.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?

Some images of your design (make sure to include both the PCB and Schematic!): -->

I am very lucky to have @dhylands as my mentor throughout the designing process: giving me valuable tips like using test points, make [test boards for subsystems](https://github.com/tobycm/OnBoard/tree/main/projects/tobydio) to test them if they actually work, and general schematic and PCB designing.
