Digital thermometers with numerical displays are boring! So, I made a temperature (and humidity!) sensing device powered by RGB Neopixel LEDs. It uses an AHT20 temperature & humidity sensor to sense how hot, cold, or humid it is, then displays the temperature using a 10-LED colored gradient, and the humitity using a 7-LED scale.

It's designed to work with temperatures from 15°C to 25°C (i.e. normal room temperature ranges for the UK), and relative humidity values from 30% to 100%. This could be changed by tweaking the silkscren text and the software, though.
