# NeoPixel Themometer

## Wokwi link

Wokwi link: <https://wokwi.com/projects/428115663410135041>

Note that Wikwi doesn't support any I2C temperature sensors like the AHT20 module I am using, so I have written placeholder functions that return random dummy data for the Wokwi simulation. Naturally, this would be replaced by code that reads actual temperature/humidity data from the sensor. I have written some code using the [SparkFun AHT20](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Humidity_AHT20_Arduino_Library) library below, although this has not been tested.

### Code to be added for AHT20 support

```ino
#include <Wire.h>
#include <SparkFun_Qwiic_Humidity_AHT20.h>
```

```ino
AHT20 sensor;
```

```ino
float getTemperature() {
  return sensor.getTemperature();
}
```

```ino
float getHumidity() {
  return sensor.getHumidity();
}
```

In `setup()`:

```ino
Wire.begin();
if (sensor.begin()) {
  Serial.println("Found AHT20 sensor")
} else {
  Serial.println("Fatal error: AHT20 not found")
  while (1);
}
```

## About

Digital thermometers with numerical displays are boring! So, I made a temperature (and humidity!) sensing device powered by RGB NeoPixel LEDs. It uses an AHT20 temperature & humidity sensor to sense how hot, cold, or humid it is, then displays the temperature using a 10-LED colored gradient, and the humitity using a 7-LED scale.

It's designed to work with temperatures from 15°C to 25°C (i.e. normal room temperature ranges for the UK), and relative humidity values from 30% to 100%. This could be changed by tweaking the silkscren text and the software, though.

## Design process

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? -->

Once I had the idea for the project, I made a simple [mockup of the LED layout](https://www.tldraw.com/f/wIqEhbxRnkui7VBJU_q1x?d=v330.1.2188.1465.YdsrRqgbpH172HVnukqYR) in tldraw.

This was my first time designing a PCB, and I chose to use [EasyEDA Pro](https://pro.easyeda.com/) to design the schematic and PCB. I read through some of the PCB Hack Club Jams to learn how to do PCB things - I foudn the [SparkleTilt jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sparkletilt-pcb/part-1) to be incredibly helpful.

I went through 3 stages of ovecomplicating and then simplifying:

If I could, I'd have given some advice to my past self:

- Properly think about where you'd want the componenets on the real thing when you're making the schematic, because it makes creating the PCB way easier
  - I did this to an extent, but I failed to consider that I'd want the Xiao's USB port at the bottom of the board, and making that change meant that I had to flip quite a few components around.
- Read _all_ of the Pixeldust guide, to learn that I don't need a decoupling capacitor for _every single NeoPixel_
  - My design included a capacitor for every NeoPixel, and I now realise that that's not required. (But it's too late to update the design now!)
  - Alternatively, talk to my friend who knows about PCBs earlier, because he spotted the issue too.
- Use the cheaper, more common 0402 package size for capacitors, instead of the default tiny 0201 capacitor size that EasyEDA gives you
