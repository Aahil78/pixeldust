## This is my submission for pixeldust YSWS fro Hack Club

The `PCB` dir Contains the Schematics and gerbers while the `Software` dir contains the `c++` Code
This PCB Designs holds 30 `SK6812` NeoPixel LEDS with a package size of 5050. it has a seed studio XIAO ESP32-C3 as the MCU 
it currently cycles through the RGB colorspace since wokwi doesn't have a way to test out w different portals just yet
`https://wokwi.com/projects/426772422246477825` use this link to visit the project at wokwi. i'll be adding more features once
i get this build in my hands thanks for reading <3.

I call this board the MoodMatrix since the LEDs are in  a 6x5 Matrix shape.
My slack ID is `U07FEFY2DNC`
