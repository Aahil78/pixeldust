<!-- Uncomment the line below if you need a soldering iron -->
<!-- ⚠️ I would like to [reason for iron], so I would need a soldering iron. -->

Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? Please add a lot of pictures here!!

This board is just a LED that represents my initials SM. It has a rainbow effect, and I can also make it wirelessely reactive since it runs on an ESP32.

Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?

Since this was my first design model, the process was a little confusing and I struggled to understant how it worked initially. However, with some guidance from others I was able to go to go through the entire process relatively smoothly and am proud of the reltively simple design I came up with.

Some images of your design (make sure to include both the PCB and Schematic!):
