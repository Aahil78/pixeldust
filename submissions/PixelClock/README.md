# pixelClock

[https://wokwi.com/projects/429875870626598913](https://wokwi.com/projects/429875870626598913)

⚠️ I would like to solder way more than 50 neopixels and a bunch of caps, so I would need a hotplate.

This is a grid of SK6821MINI leds. It is designed mainly to be used as a clock, but the surrounding leds could also be used for other things, and I'm planning on adding a alarm with a webpage later.
