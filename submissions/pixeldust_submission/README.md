<h3>Project Info:</h3>
I made a rectangular 6x6 LED screen with a temperature sensor. <br>
I wanted to see it do cool patterns, and am probably going to expand on the firmware later.<br>
Based on the temperature, the LEDs will be either a warm color, or a cool color<br>
Theres a different few functions in the firmware<br>
