It's a simple 7x7 LED matrix to display different designs for my FRC team Wave Robotics. I may also plan on adding web support some how so I could upload a 7x7 image, or maybe just make it simpler to customize. But as of right now it display the text `WAVE 2826` by flashing each character (execpt the space) independently.

Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped?
The main challenge was programming it as I wired it in kind of a weird way as I went top to bottom, when matrixes normally go side to side, also wiring it to keep it compact was hard, as the traces are very close togeather.
